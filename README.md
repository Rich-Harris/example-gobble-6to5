# gobble example with babel and RequireJS

This is in response to [this question](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble/issues/32) about how to set up gobble with babel (or 6to5, when the question was asked) and RequireJS.

After cloning the gist, `npm install` and `bower install`, then run `npm start`.
